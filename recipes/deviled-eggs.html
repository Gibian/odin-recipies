        <h3>Ingredients:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>12 eggs</li>
            <li>1/2 c. mayonnaise</li>
            <li>4 slices of bacon</li>
            <li>2 tbsp. finely shredded Cheddar cheese</li>
            <li>1 tbsp. mustard</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Steps:</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>
                Place eggs in a saucepan, and cover with cold water. Bring water to a boil and immediately <br>
                remove from heat. Cover, and let eggs stand in hot water for 10 to 12 minutes. Remove from hot water, <br>
                and cool. To cool more quickly, rinse eggs under cold running water.
            </li>
            <li>
                Meanwhile, place bacon in a large, deep skillet. Cook over medium-high heat until evenly brown. <br>
                Alternatively, wrap bacon in paper towels and cook in the microwave for about 1 minute per slice. <br>
                Crumble and set aside.
            </li>
            <li>
                Peel the hard-cooked eggs, and cut in half lengthwise. Remove yolks to a small bowl. Mash egg yolks <br> 
                with mayonnaise, crumbled bacon and cheese. Stir in mustard. Fill egg white halves with the yolk <br>
                mixture and refrigerate until serving.
