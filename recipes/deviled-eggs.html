                <li>
                    Place eggs in a saucepan, and cover with cold water. Bring water to a boil and immediately <br>
                    remove from heat. Cover, and let eggs stand in hot water for 10 to 12 minutes. Remove from hot water, <br>
                    and cool. To cool more quickly, rinse eggs under cold running water.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Meanwhile, place bacon in a large, deep skillet. Cook over medium-high heat until evenly brown. <br>
                    Alternatively, wrap bacon in paper towels and cook in the microwave for about 1 minute per slice. <br>
                    Crumble and set aside.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Peel the hard-cooked eggs, and cut in half lengthwise. Remove yolks to a small bowl. Mash egg yolks <br> 
                    with mayonnaise, crumbled bacon and cheese. Stir in mustard. Fill egg white halves with the yolk <br>
                    mixture and refrigerate until serving.
